Every morning when I wake up, I know I\'ll be making a difference in the lives of those around me. That I\'ll be helping to serve and protect those who matter most. And that, of course, gunfire has absolutely no chance of ever hurting me at all.</p>\r\n<p>Really, though, being 100 percent bulletproof is such a great perk that it practically goes without saying. In fact, whenever I do mention it, the other cops just look at me like I\'m crazy. It\'s like they\'re thinking, &quot;Yeah, no duh, Rick. Having bullets bounce off your face is so obviously the best part of the job. Please tell us something we\'re not aware of.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>I know, I know, I\'m still green, but I can\'t help it. I just love being bulletproof!</p>\r\n<p>Part of me hopes I\'ll never be like those other officers. They take being immune to firearms totally for granted. They seem pretty bitter and jaded, to tell you the truth. Take yesterday afternoon, for instance. I walked out onto the shooting range\Zafter dropping my gun for like the 10th time\Zand suddenly everyone starts yelling at me.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s like, relax, you know? I\'m only going to be blocking your targets for a few seconds. Just bounce a couple rounds off my ass if I\'m in your way, don\'t scream at me!</p>\r\n<p>Honestly, I don\'t know why they even give us weapons in the first place. I can\'t speak for my colleagues, but it\'s not like I\'m a great shot or anything. In fact, I probably couldn\'t hit the broad side of a barn if my life depended on it, which, lucky for me, it doesn\'t.</p>\r\n<p>It seems like I forget my gun at home half the time anyway. Even if I had it, and a suspect was shooting at me, I probably wouldn\'t draw the thing. Why bother? It always gets caught in my holster, and besides, I can just walk up and grab the suspect while his bullets land harmlessly at my feet. Still, I suppose that rules are rules, and the gun is part of the uniform. It\'s mostly tradition, I guess.</p>\r\n<p>Like that Kevlar vest I\'m supposed to wear. Where the hell that thing went, I couldn\'t tell you.</p>\r\n<p>Now, I know that being impervious to bullets doesn\'t mean I\'m invincible or anything. I found out the hard way during a routine traffic stop last week that bullet-immunity does <i>not</i>, for example, extend to Tasers. Yes, I know what you\'re thinking, and it doesn\'t make much sense to me, either. It would stand to reason that since I can take a shotgun blast to the gut (can\'t wait!) and walk away without so much as a scratch, a little electricity wouldn\'t be a problem, but there you go. All I can say is, if that\'s the price you have to pay to be able to effortlessly deflect hollow-point shells, then so be it.</p>\r\n<p>God, it\'s going to be so incredibly great the first time I get shot.</p>\r\n<p>I probably shouldn\'t be telling you this, but I\'m supposed to go on a big meth lab raid tomorrow morning. According to the part of the briefing I listened to\Zthe tone of which seemed a bit somber, if you ask me\Zthese guys are heavily, heavily armed. So I\'m almost guaranteed to be shot then. Who knows? Maybe I\'ll even get it in the back of the head!</p>\r\n<p>I only wish I were a sergeant so I could turn invisible, too. <img src=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/themes/onion/assets/terminator.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"terminator\" /></p>', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2009-03-02 10:36:19', '1', '7F0000010760119260opv38183DE', '', '', '/Commentary/The-Best-Part-Of-Being-A-Cop-Is-Knowing-That-Youre-Completely-Impervious-To-Bullets/', '', '', '', NULL);

I finally get the chance to go on a little vacation for a couple of days, but instead of relaxing, I\'m just a tightly wound ball of anxiety. I turned off all my appliances before I left, stored my valuables in a safe place, threw away all my perishable food items, and I thought, I <i>thought</i> I made the necessary arrangements to have my neighbor and international violin sensation Itzhak Perlman feed my cat.</p>\r\n<p>Turns out, the preeminent violinist of our time is a big fat flake. Because, as it so happens, I turned on the television just now, flipped to PBS, and there he was: Itzhak Perlman, sitting in his little chair and playing his little fiddle at the Copenhagen Concert Hall, live.</p>\r\n<p>Uh, Itzhak, you forgetting something? Like Boswell maybe?</p>\r\n<p>I remember our conversation quite clearly. I said, &quot;Hey, Itzhak, I don\'t know if you\'re busy dazzling millions of people with your prodigious interpretations of Stravinsky or whatever, but I\'m going away for a few days, and if you could feed Boswell I would really appreciate it.&quot; And Itzhak said, yes, he\'d love to feed Boswell. He even said that he would clean out his litter box.</p>\r\n<p>Fast-forward three days later, and here I am watching the guy play an uplifting, hour-long concerto about 2,500 miles from my poor cat\'s unopened cans of Fancy Feast.</p>\r\n<p>You know, he could have just said no. I realize that people are busy working, or taking care of their kids, or teaching a master class of violinists that the Adagio of Paganini\'s First Concerto should never be played tepidly. I get that. And even though Itzhak owes me because I let him borrow my Igloo cooler for his camping trip last summer, I still would have understood. But it turns out you can\'t trust a grown adult who studied at Juilliard with such modern legends as Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay to handle feeding a cat for three days.</p>\r\n<p>I guess Boswell\'s life just isn\'t that important to him. Maybe I should have said, &quot;Hey, Itzhak, could you feed my 300-year-old Stradivarius violin for a couple of days?&quot; I bet that would have kept him in the United States for the weekend.</p>\r\n<p>He left me no warning, no voice mail. Not even a little, &quot;Leonard, Itzhak here. Just realized I got a gig this weekend. Can\'t feed the Bozman. See ya.&quot; That would have been completely fine. But instead, I have to turn on PBS\'s <i>Great Performances</i> to find out that the reigning virtuoso of classical violin has totally screwed me over.</p>\r\n<p>Man, what an irresponsible asshole Itzhak Perlman ended up being. A good violin player, sure, but all things considered, a real shit neighbor.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s see, if my calculations are correct, and Itzhak left for Copenhagen a day early so he could really get a feel for the sound and acoustics of the hall, and factoring in that he\'s playing the Elgar\Za concerto that, lucky me, is twice as long as anything by Bach or Mozart\Zand considering that the prima donna hasn\'t even gotten to his big cadenza in the third movement yet....</p>\r\n<p>Boswell has probably not eaten anything for a day and a half, maybe two.</p>\r\n<p>My cat could be dead right now. Dead. He might have collapsed after pawing at the door, waiting for Itzhak Perlman to walk in with a tin can of succulent turkey and gravy. But no, Boswell, Itzhak Perlman isn\'t coming. No, Mr. Undeniable Master of the Demanding Final Movement of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto decided to run off to another continent. He\'s too busy enchanting thousands of people with his superb finger work, his awe-inspiring musical interpretation, his ability to paint a beautiful picture with just a few strings and a bow, and\Z. Hold on a minute. Is that premier American jazz musician Wynton Marsalis sitting behind him, playing trumpet? Jesus Christ, then who the hell is sorting my mail? Is my mail just piling up? That really burns my\Z. Is that? Did Pl?cido Domingo just walk out on stage to sing the role of Cavaradossi in Tosca? Then who, may I ask, is going to make sure my car is on the right side of the road for Sunday street cleaning?</p>\r\n<p>Here I was thinking I had these great friends whom I could count on in life, but when it comes down to it, they\'re just too wrapped up in themselves to give a damn.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m going to have to fly back. This is unbelievable. Un-fucking-believable. Way to go, Itzhak, you ruined my entire vacation to Myrtle Beach. Ruined it! I was really looking forward to going swimming with the dolphins tomorrow, but because of the irresponsible actions of a certain world-renown violinist I know, I am going to go home and feed my damn cat.</p>\r\n<p>Or maybe I can get my brother-in-law, <i>NBC Nightly News</i> lead anchor Brian Williams, to do it. <img src=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/themes/onion/assets/terminator.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"terminator\" /></p>', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2009-03-02 10:36:09', '1', '7F0000010760119260VwO3818436', '', '', '/Commentary/If-Itzhak-Perlman-Is-Performing-On-TV-Right-Now-Who-Is-Feeding-My-Cat/', '', '', '', NULL);

to American smokers.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;For far too long, this lowlife criminal has preyed upon unsuspecting cigarette owners,&quot; ATF spokesman Stuart Thompson said. &quot;However, we are confident that recent developments will finally allow us to bring down this menace to justice once and for all.&quot;</p>\r\n<div style=\"width: 250px;\" class=\"article_photo\"><a onclick=\"javascript:open(\'http://www.theonion.com/content/node/93484\', \'enlarge_image_window\', \'width=620px, height=582px, scrollbars=yes, lend=20px, top=20px\');\" href=\"javascript:void(0);\"> 		<span>Enlarge Image</span> 		<img width=\"250\" height=\"180\" title=\"ATF Agents Meeting\" alt=\"ATF Agents Meeting\" src=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/files/images/ATF-Agents-Jump-R.article.jpg\" /></a>\r\n<p>Agents investigating the site of the most recent bumming believe the fugitive may have struck four times in one night.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&quot;Mark my words,&quot; Thompson continued. &quot;His days of annoying the living crap out of smokers everywhere will soon be over.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Representing the largest investigation in ATF history, the nationwide dragnet has nearly exhausted the agency\'s resources, with daily operating costs exceeding $2.5 million, and more than 1,500 federal agents being mobilized in hopes of stopping the serial bummer before he strikes again.</p>\r\n<p>A special bulletin released by the ATF warned that citizens should be on the lookout for a Caucasian male in his early to mid-20s, with absolutely no sense of social etiquette whatsoever. The moocher is reportedly also known for having never once purchased his own pack of cigarettes, falsely claiming that he only smokes when he\'s been drinking, and thanking his victims to an insufferable degree after the bumming has occurred.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, investigators have described the freeloader as being constantly in need of a light.</p>\r\n<p>Despite tracking the suspect on his cigarette-bumming spree across three state lines, investigators have failed to detect any discernable pattern to the mooching. Preliminary analysis has concluded that the perpetrator is equally comfortable stalking his victims around college campuses, parks, local bars, and at all hours of the day and night.</p>\r\n<p>In each instance, however, the moocher was observed to exploit the sympathies of nearby smokers by claiming that he had &quot;just smoked his last one.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;This individual will say anything to get a cigarette,&quot; said ATF agent Gene Lorenzo, who while searching the agency\'s database found 20,000 instances of the offender alleging that he was totally trying to quit, but was having a shitty day. &quot;He\'s a smooth talker who befriends you, and before you know what\'s going on, half your pack is gone.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;And trust me,&quot; Lorenzo added. &quot;He\'s never going to get you back like he promises. Never.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Since 2001, the ATF has conducted interviews with people who have encountered the cigarette bummer to better understand how he chooses his victims. Diane Gustercan, a Denver bank teller, said the culprit first approached her when she was having a smoke after work.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;It was awful,&quot; said Gustercan, who helped officials assemble a profile of the bummer. &quot;He came straight up to me and he said, \'I hate to be that guy, and I hate to even ask, but do you think I could get a smoke off you?\'&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;I felt so helpless,&quot; Gustercan continued. &quot;It was like there was nothing I could do.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;No smoker is safe while that man\'s still out there,&quot; Kentucky resident and local barfly Dale Richardson said. &quot;He hit me up three times in the same night. Tried to chat with me for a little bit too so I wouldn\'t feel bad about it. I finally just gave him a cigarette so he\'d leave me the hell alone.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>According to an internal report, the perpetrator uses a number of clever cons to successfully mooch cigarettes. The agency\'s data confirmed that these include halfheartedly offering to pay 25 cents for a smoke, and hovering around two people engaged in conversation while desperately miming for a cigarette with his index and middle fingers.</p>\r\n<p>Despite working with local law enforcement across the country, the ATF has for months struggled to home in on the suspect, largely because he leaves so few clues behind.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Six months ago, we received a tip that the moocher was at a Staples parking lot in Omaha,&quot; agent Alex Leonard said. &quot;We spent hours combing the area and finally came up with a cigarette, but it was burned beyond all recognition.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;He definitely knows what he\'s doing,&quot; Leonard continued. &quot;Sooner or later though, he\'s bound to slip up.

uttered Michigan resident and mother of four Margaret Hochschild, who, along with her husband, was laid off more than three months ago. &quot;Children, grab your coats and follow Mommy. We\'re going out now.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The mysterious line, which currently stretches across seven states, first took shape around 8 a.m., when former Pennsylvania steel worker Gerald Wilkins stood up from his porch and, without saying a word, walked to the corner of Douglas Street and Maple Avenue.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, hundreds of thousands of Americans have followed in Wilkins\' path, their feet suddenly carrying them to a destination they knew not.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;I was on the phone with my bank when it happened,&quot; said Dennis Weinback, an out-of-work school teacher from Alabama who has already made 85 cents selling wooden pencils to others in line. &quot;I just put down the receiver, got dressed, and walked out the front door.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Added Weinback, &quot;I don\'t really remember it, but I must have also made a trip to the attic, because I was wearing my grandfather\'s old tweed jacket when I got here.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>In the hours since the breadline formed, a number of unexpected and vaguely familiar events have taken place. Shortly after 10 a.m., three men slowly approached a nearby trash can, filled it with old newspaper, and lit a fire to warm their weary hands. Minutes later, observers reported seeing several women, suddenly overcome with inexplicable sorrow, pull their children close to the warmth of their breast.</p>\r\n<p>The first few bars of a wistful folk song, cries from a hungry infant, and the tense, frightened whispers of &quot;rations&quot; were also heard at this time.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;What\'s happening to us?&quot; California resident Rebecca Baker said after glimpsing a group of investment bankers leaning against a broken-down jalopy, their suit pants rolled up to the calf and their feet muddied and bare. &quot;Why\Zwhy is that man carrying a bindle?&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Stretching past abandoned car factories, repossessed farms gone to seed, and shuttered strip malls, the lengthy breadline isn\Zt the only new development across the country. In Detroit, giant vats of soup have been carried out and onto the streets\Zthe scent of thinned-out broth jogging a kind of distant memory. Meanwhile in St. Louis, volunteers have been sent door to door, collecting scrap metal and old nylon stockings in support of the war effort overseas.</p>\r\n<p>Early reports indicate that scarlet fever has also broken out in a number of U.S. cities, including New Orleans, Atlanta, and Jackson, MS.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Will work for food! Will work for food!&quot; cried unshaven Arizona resident Ed Gallagher, who, upon waking this morning, intuitively put on a sandwich board, rinsed his face in a pail of water, and started wandering the streets in search of work. &quot;Have graphic design experience! Will work for food!&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;We\'ve lost everything,&quot; said Janice Mann, an Iowa native, who watched helplessly as dozens of so-called Bushvilles sprung up across her state. &quot;The land, the house\Zit\'s all gone. They say this could last an entire decade. That it\'s going to get worse before it gets any better.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>At press time, nearly 250 million Americans had found themselves waiting in line for bread. Though few could explain how they wound up huddled together in the cold, clad in threadbare fedoras and fingerless black gloves, others seemed less surprised.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;I told \'em it was coming,&quot; said 97-year-old Wyoming man Howard MacGregor. &quot;They didn\'t listen to me, oh, no, but I tolds them.

Meyer said while administering one more in an endless series of lapdances. &quot;You better believe I\'ll be out of here the minute I either die or become so old that no man will pay to see me naked.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;I\'ve got dreams a lot bigger than this dump,&quot; Meyer continued. &quot;I\'m only doing this because there\'s no way I\'ll ever come close to achieving those dreams.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Meyer, 24, accepted her current position three months ago to &quot;pick up a little extra cash&quot; for food, clothing, and shelter. She told reporters that stripping allows her the freedom to barely chip away at her enormous debt while still being able to save absolutely nothing for the future.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;The hours are flexible, and the money\'s pretty good for a girl trying to pay for the basic necessities required to continue breathing,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;Trust me, I know better than anyone how demeaning this job can be, but I also know it\'s just a means to an end.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Specifically, the end of my fleeting youth and my ability to trust anyone ever again,&quot; Meyer added.</p>\r\n<p>Though Meyer has to contend with constant harassment from her disgusting boss, and borderline sexual assault from drunken or obsessed patrons, she remains certain that, due to the nature of mortality, she\'ll eventually be able to put her stripping days behind her.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Can you imagine how gross it would be to tell someone that you\'re a 40-year-old stripper?&quot; Meyer said. &quot;There\'s no way I\'ll let that happen to me. That\'s why I plan to start lying as I get older and say that I\'m a waitress or a nurse or something.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to putting herself through a bleak and hopeless existence by cheapening herself nightly, Meyer is also supporting her abusive, unemployed boyfriend, 34-year-old James Keller.</p>\r\n<p>Meyer claimed that much of her money, as well as all of her remaining faith in humanity, will go to Keller just until he gets back on his feet and runs off with another stripper, most likely one of Meyer\'s close friends.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;I\'m just helping Jimmy out until he gets me pregnant and takes off to go live with his mom in Oklahoma,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;After we get over that hump, it\'ll just be me and his bastard kid, who will destroy both any chance I ever had of dating a decent guy, as well as our only source of income: my taut, lean body.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>Those who frequent Klassy Dolls have reportedly offered their support for Meyer\'s life plan. Bo Lewiston, 42, a twice-divorced auto-body shop owner who frequently breaks the nightclub\'s rules by forcing his hands into Meyer\'s G-string, said he has no doubt that the beautiful 24-year-old will attain the minimal subsistence-oriented goals she has laid out for herself.</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Nina is a wonderful gal with a great head on her shoulders,&quot; Lewiston said while leering dangerously at Meyer. &quot;Hell, if she tries hard enough and develops a meth habit, she could fatally overdose and be out of Klassy Dolls in just a few months.&quot;<img class=\"terminator\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/themes/onion/assets/terminator.gif\" /></p>', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2009-03-02 10:34:15', '1', '7F0000010760118B76uSX37ED83F', '', '', '/News/Stripper-Putting-Herself-Through-Life/', '', '', '', NULL);

Our graduates need to know about those who lie beneath the earth, waiting until the stars align so they can return to their rightful place as our masters <i>and wage war against the Elder Things and the shoggoths</i>!&quot;</p>\r\n<p>The controversial school board member reportedly interrupted a heated discussion about adding fresh fruit to school lunches in order to bring his motion to the table. With the aid of a flip chart, West laid out his six-point plan for increased madness, which included field trips to the medieval metaphysics department at Miskatonic University, instruction in the incantations of Yog-Sothoth, and a walkathon sponsored by local businesses to raise money for the freshman basketball program.</p>\r\n<div class=\"article_photo\" style=\"width: 250px;\"><a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"javascript:open(\'http://www.theonion.com/content/node/93543\', \'enlarge_image_window\', \'width=620px, height=784px, scrollbars=yes, lend=20px, top=20px\');\"> 		<span>Enlarge Image</span> 		<img width=\"250\" height=\"264\" src=\"http://www.theonion.com/content/files/images/Lovecraftian-School-Jump-R.article.jpg\" alt=\"Lovecraftian\" title=\"Lovecraftian\" /></a>\r\n<p>Artist\'s rendering of the Cthulhu, a hideous demon borne of pure malice that fewer than 3 percent of high school sophomores can identify.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&quot;Our schools are orderly, sanitary places where students dwell in blissful ignorance of the chaos that awaits,&quot; West said. &quot;Should our facilities be repaired?
